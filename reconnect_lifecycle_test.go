// never end in a state nobody can get out of.
//
// The consumer contract this protects: benthos-umh never calls Reconnect and
// never inspects the FSM. It polls IsClosed(), and on true it drops the session
// and builds a new one (read.go:109/154). So a session that is neither connected
// nor closed is invisible to it — no data flows, nothing rebuilds, forever.
// Every exit from Reconnect must therefore leave the session Connected or Closed.

// under test. Slow enough that an ignored cancellation is visibly slower than an

// transport under Connect - and the consumer must still be told about the drop.
//
// Connect owns sess.tx / sess.client from the first publishWiredClient to the
// Connected transition, but ondrop is armed across most of that: the local
// handshake, the GetSymbolVersion/ReadState liveness probe, and the runtime-state
// read. (The route stage is not exposed - it disarms - and its two helpers re-arm
// from a defer in the MIDDLE of Connect, which is how the hole got there.) A RST
// in the armed window spawned a Reconnect that ran tearDownAndReset against the
// same tx while Connect was still building it: each cancelled the other's context
// and closed the other's socket, and after a Connect the caller was told had
// failed the session sat Connected on a second connection with IsClosed() false -
// a leaked socket, the Client's workers, the runtime watcher and an unbounded
// reconnect loop, per failed Connect. Unrecoverable in place, too: a retry gets
// "Connect already in progress".
//
// The other half of the invariant, and the reason the fix is not just "suppress
// the spawn": suppressing the rival goroutine must not suppress the drop SIGNAL.
// WithOnDisconnect is the only channel a consumer that neither polls IsClosed()
// nor inspects the FSM has, and the callback fires once - on the CAS's first
