// peer_route_test.go — talking to a device that answers on its OWN connection.
//
// Measured on a TC3.1.4026 TC/RTOS device (192.168.3.224): it accepts our TCP
// connection, accepts and PROCESSES our requests, and then sends every response
// over a connection it opens back to us on 48898. Decoded from the wire:
//
//	target 192.168.3.52.1.1:10900   source 5.154.236.19.1.1:851
//	command 0x0002 Read   state 0x0005 (ADS command + response)   invokeID 1
//
// i.e. the answer to our own first GetSymbolVersion. Nothing was ever lost; a
// client-only library simply has nowhere to receive it, so every request appears
// to time out. TC2 2.10 and TC3.1.4024/CE on the same network answer on our
// connection and never dial back, so this is per-device route-entry behaviour.
//
// Registration cannot ask for anything different: Beckhoff's own AddRemoteRoute
// sends the same five tags we do (computerName, password, username, netid,
// routename) with no route-type or unidirectional flag, and their Linux AdsLib
// never binds a listening socket — so it cannot talk to a device in this state at
// all. Accepting the inbound connection is therefore a capability, not a

// pre-binds the inbound listener for a host it believes needs one, and with no
// WithAmsPeerListen that listener is wildcard :48898. Measured: seeding one entry
// for a stub's own address makes a session against a perfectly HEALTHY device
// seize :48898 for its entire lifetime — which is then the port these two tests
// need. Nothing in the failing test names the cause, and the trigger is a port
